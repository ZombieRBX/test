    <h3> Description </h3>
    A dedicated Right to repair advocate, I am Hugh Jeffreys. I have had a passion for technology and filmmaking since I was 9 years old. 
    I create YouTube videos on restoring broken phones, tablets, computers and other electronics as well as customising or modifying various
    devices to produce stunning one of a kind products. In doing this I aim to reduce the amount waste going to landfill and to educate 
    people on the topic of DIY repair.

    Check out my website for tips and links to all equipment I use. And my social media for an insight into upcoming videos, 
    behind the scenes and content that doesn't always make it to a YouTube video.
